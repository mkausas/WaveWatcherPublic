I created a Pebble watchface at WildHacks 2014 and due to the amount of attention it got at the Hackathon I have decided to polish it and publish it on the Pebble store. To protect the private api keys I am using, I have made my repository private. Sorry for the inconvinience. If you would like to know more about the watchface or would like to see the code feel free to shoot me a message.  

WaveWatcher is officially public! Find it on the Pebble Store or take a peak right here: https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/547a59063fd38805c30000f4
